# Swans

This repository contains code and data to reproduce the analyses in Soriano-Redondo et al. Demographic rates reveal the benefits of protected areas in a long-lived migratory bird (submitted to PNAS).

The code to reproduce the survival model is provided as WS_CMR_TD.R and the Capture History dataset used for that analysis is provided as Whooper_MS_Age_Encounter_5.csv. The multistate model that accounts for trap-dependence in the adult swans was adapted from KÃ©ry & Schaub (2012) by Dr Fitsum Abadi Gebreselassie (https://fwce.nmsu.edu/faculty-staff/fitsum-abadi-gebreselass.html).

The code to reproduce the final productivty model is provided as WS_Breeding_Model.R and the associated code used for that analysis is provided as StandardisedWhooperData.csv. The initial model selection using a frequentist framework (not incuded in the code) was conducted by Dr Richard Inger (https://research.com/u/richard-inger) and the model to specify the minimally adequate binomial GLMM in JAGS was coded by Dr Richard B. Sherley (https://ecologyconservation.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Richard_Sherley).

The code to reproduce the final productivty model is provided as WS_Breeding_Model.R and the associated code used for that analysis is provided as StandardisedWhooperData.csv.
